# Instructions
Please be sure to read everything here before beginning! You may have a better way of doing things than the way I did.
## Assembling the PCB
* Teensy
  * Please view this gallery of images:

  * Please note, this is how I did it; you may find an easier way. The main point is to keep the Teensy as flush with the PCB as possible. There is no circuitry under the Teensy to worry about shorting; however, take care not to damage the silkscreen layer as there is insulation copper underneath.
  1) Break up your headers into chunks of 2.
  2) Align them through the back of the Teensy, long end first, organized as shown. It helps to tape the Teensy and pins down at this time.
  3) Put the Teensy and pins into the PCB, with the Teensy going on the side that says "GarlicBoard."
  4) Solder the pins on the PCB side.
  5) Flip the board over and remove the tape and Teensy.
  6) Using pliers, carefully pull up on the plastic as shown to remove header spacers. This is the reason we broke them up earlier.
  7) Place the Teensy back into the pins, and snug it down as far as it'll go.
  8) Solder the Teensy in place, and then clip the pins short (Not shown). It may help, in hindsight, to clip the pins short and then solder the Teensy in place. One issue I've run into is that the pins will loosen from the PCB and sag a bit.

* Diodes
  * Diodes are soldered onto the board with the | directional line pointing to the left (Towards the numpad, see image). The text "T4" should also be right side up.
  * _IMPORTANT NOTE:_ The two spacebar diodes do not follow this rule; they are upside down.

* Resistors
  * Resistors are for the 4 LEDs; their positions are marked by "R" on the front side of the PCB.
  * The orientation of the resistors does not matter.
  * See this video for the varying levels of brightness; the dimmest is a 1500ohm resistor, the brightest is a 150ohm. The ones in between are the varying levels included with the kit.

* LEDs
  * Included are orange LEDs. The | line points to the north on the top three LEDs, and it points to the south on the bottom LED.

## Case and Plate Files
* The plate files that I designed can be downloaded in the GarlicBoardCaseFiles.zip. They are my current design for a very slim sandwhich board that leaves little margin for error; this is just a sample design and probably not ideal.
  * GarlicBoardCase.zip includes all files in both SVG and PDF formats.
  * GarlicBoardPlate.zip includes just the plate file in SVG and PDF formats.
  * GarlicBoardLightGuides.zip inlcudes just the light guides in SVG and PDF formats. Not that the rectangles are not light guides, but extra filler pieces. Only 4 light guides are needed, but cutting 8 is advised as they are small and easy to lose.
* You can use these two sites for your plate design:
  * http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/deefedea4f1e6f569e215b70d19be315
  * http://builder.swillkb.com
* The plate SVG in the  however, is built off of the layer from the actual kiCAD design files; it is what I used when I had my plate cut. If you use the swillkb.com tool, I recommend printing it out on paper before hand to make sure that all of the holes line up.
* OTHER NOTES:
  * The plate needs to have four 2mm x 2mm holes centered over the LEDs.
  * The LightChannel files are designed to stradle over the LEDs in an upside down position and insert into the plate as seen here.
    * Image:
    * It may help to use something such as rubber cement to hld the light channels into place.

## Firmware
* The firmware is currently still in beta. It is being created using kbfirmware.com; everything is functioning at this time _except_ for the LEDs. Unfortunately I do not have the know how to implement these. See layout below for the current layout.
* You can upload the .json file to kbfirmware.com and it will load everything into its proper place for editing.

## Layout
* See image for current layout:
  * Image: http://i.imgur.com/CS0u64L.png
* Notes:
  * Currently FN1 + Enter = ' and FN1 + Shift + Enter = "
    * This may not be ideal as during the adjustment process, the Enter key can be hit inadvertently.
  * FN1 + R Shift = / and FN1 + L Shift + R Shift = ?
  * L FN1 or R FN1 + Pad Lock will lock the keyboard, rendering all keys inoperative. To unlock, Right FN1 + Pad Lock will release the keys. You can also unplug and replug in the keyboard to reset the firmware.
  * FN1 + the 00 key on the keypad will swap the positions of the Left FN1 and Spacebar. Doing this combo again will switch them back.
 Â * At this time the 00 key only outputs 0 due to there not being a 00 keycode in QMK. I plan to implement a macro to do two 0s, but again at this time I do not know how to program this.
